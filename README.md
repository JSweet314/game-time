# Game Time!
#### By: Jonathan Sweet and Charles Yach

### Getting Started
* Clone down this repo and run `npm install`.
* Start the game by running `npm start` and visiting localhost:8080 in your browser.
* Test suite can be run with terminal command `npm test`
* Eslint can be run with `npm run eslint`

The purpose of this project was to get practice with objects, inheritance, ES6 syntax, and the HTML Canvas element. We utilized TDD with Mocha and Chai, Babel to ensure browser compatibility with ES6, and ESLint to ensure consistently readable code. Additionally, we use webpack to bundle our files and take a modular approach.
